That's why we put together this series of quick lessons (https://www.geckoboard.com/blog/topics/leadership/?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=data-fallacy-cards-CM-email&utm_source=Geckoboard+Community&utm_campaign=c17f17f45e-CM11+-+Data+Fallacy+Cards&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1d9b0f4b86-c17f17f45e-416158125) to help you spot fallacies in data or call out dodgy visualizations. That way, you can use data with confidence and make better decisions in both work and life. With each card below, we provided a blog post explaining the fallacy in greater detail, how each is applied in business, and how to avoid that fallacy in your work.

A corrections officer was on his way to work.  Any loss of life is a tragedy, and the death toll is certain to go up, but it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable the extent to which the human cost of a storm as destructive and powerful as this one \xe2\x80\x94 which will cause untold billions in property damage \xe2\x80\x94 can be mitigated.  Forecasting has improved dramatically over the past century, as has the quality of construction.

(AP/File)  -- Erik Larson wrote a gripping account of the Galveston hurricane in a 1999 book called \xe2\x80\x9cIsaac\xe2\x80\x99s Storm.\xe2\x80\x9d <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d2d/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/15/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a> The protagonist is Texas\xe2\x80\x99s chief weatherman Isaac Monroe Cline, who led the Galveston observation office of the United States Weather Bureau when the storm hit and lost his wife to the storm surge. For a full decade leading up to the devastation, Cline insisted publicly that the idea Galveston could ever be \xe2\x80\x9cseriously damaged\xe2\x80\x9d by a hurricane was \xe2\x80\x9csimply an absurd delusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be impossible for any cyclone to create a storm wave which would materially injure the city,\xe2\x80\x9d Cline wrote in a piece for the Galveston News. That op-ed helped dissuade city fathers from investing in a sea wall that could have saved thousands of lives when the storm came.  Cline was once on his way to Mexico for a work trip when his steamship encountered a low-intensity hurricane. Rather than counting his blessings, the meteorologist concluded (insanely) that hurricanes were more survivable than conventional wisdom depicted.  He b eved he was an especially gifted, even brilliant, scientist. But, Larson writes, \xe2\x80\x9che did not know there was such a thing as the jet stream, or that easterly waves marched from the coast of West Africa every summer, or that a massive flow within the Atlantic Ocean ferried heat around the globe. Nor had he heard of a phenomenon called El Nino.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cuba had pioneered hurricane detection, and its meteorologists at the time held a more sophisticated understanding of how these storms worked than the Americans. But the forecasters from the United States, which maintained a heavy military presence on the island in the wake of the Spanish-American War, foolishly dismissed them all as backward and laughed at their methods. Trying to centralize control of forecasting, the Weather Bureau persuaded the War Department to ban telegraph operators on Cuba from transmitting forecasts unless they were from the U.S. government. That meant that key information was not passed to the U.S. mainland as the hurricane barreled toward Galveston.  Experts knew a storm was coming, but they had no idea how intense it was or what course it was on. Ironically, because of missing measurements and analysts wrongly interpreting what limited data they had, the government b eved that it was a tropical storm and that it was heading for Tampa \xe2\x80\x94 not Texas. An advisory was sent out saying as much just hours before the hurricane hit Galveston. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bureau had few hard facts about the storm, yet what is remarkable about its cables that day is the complete absence of doubt or qualification,\xe2\x80\x9d Larson writes.  Serious people mistook signs back then that would be obvious today to anyone who paid even a little attention in their high school science classes. Swells were coming in very slowly at Galveston, at intervals between one to five minutes. This should have been a red flag, obviously, but it somehow reassured people who were on the beach that the storm wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be too bad.  Other mistakes were made that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be repeated today. Concerned about fire, for instance, the city required that all roofs be shingled with slate, not wood. That made the hurricane much deadlier when the slate started flying around.  <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d2e/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/16/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a>  Miami before and after Hurricane Irma hit  -- In its April edition, Popular Science chronicled <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d2f/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/17/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a> how much the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s satellites and technology for interpreting data have improved even in the past few decades: \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough predicting where tumultuous weather might go is challenging, NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s errors in storm tracking have been cut in half in the last 12 to 15 years \xe2\x80\xa6 And beginning five years ago, the agency could give imperiled residents 12 more hours of notice that a hurricane was expected to hit (we now get 36 hours of advanced noticed \xe2\x80\x94 up from 24 hours). \xe2\x80\xa6 In a 2007 study published in Natural Hazards Review, scientists demonstrated that improved storm forecasting prevented up to 90 percent of deaths that would have occurred should satellite-less, error-prone technology still have been used to predict hurricanes. The researchers found that between 1970 and 2004, an average of around 20 people died from hurricanes each year. But if forecasts were as faulty as they were in the 1950s, they estimated that 200 people would have died each year, simply because significantly more people had settled into the path of destructive cyclones. \xe2\x80\x98The bottom line is that the number of deaths have been going down, but the coastal population has been going up,\xe2\x80\x99 says Hugh Willoughby, the study\'s lead author and a hurricane researcher at Florida International University.\xe2\x80\x9d  <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d30/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/18/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a>  Floodwaters engulf Miami neighborhood  -- There has also been a paradigm shift in how public officials prepare for storms. Politicians have become more likely over time to err on the side of caution when it comes to ordering evacuations. Back in 1900, the Weather Bureau (which became the National Weather Service in 1970) banned the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9ctornado\xe2\x80\x9d in dispatches to avoid panicking people. The government-run network also \xe2\x80\x9ctook special pains to avoid using the word hurricane, except when absolutely necessary or when stipulating that a particular storm was not a hurricane,\xe2\x80\x9d Larson writes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Weather Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to use words like hurricane and cyclone inadvertently reinforced the bravado of sea captains.\xe2\x80\x9d  -- While many still die from big hurricanes \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0Katrina took about 1,200 lives in 2005 \xe2\x80\x94 the causes of death are different than in the past: \xe2\x80\x9cMany deaths that follow a big storm in the U.S. come in the days and weeks afterward \xe2\x80\x94 especially if there are power outages,\xe2\x80\x9d NBC News reported last year <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d31/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/19/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a>. \xe2\x80\x9cCarbon monoxide poisoning often leads the list, as people turn to grills and gas stoves. \xe2\x80\x98About 70 people die every year and many more are injured from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by portable generators,\xe2\x80\x99 the Consumer Product Safety Commission warns. \xe2\x80\x98Carbon monoxide (CO) from a generator used indoors can kill you and your family in minutes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6 In 2008, Hurricane Ike hit the Texas coast near Galveston, killing 74 people in Texas and Louisiana.

In this new age, nature itself seemed no great obstacle.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even though they\xe2\x80\x99re vastly more accurate, today\xe2\x80\x99s forecasts include nuance and acknowledge uncertainty. For most of last week, it remained unclear whether Irma would make landfall on the east or west coast of Florida, for example, and the government\xe2\x80\x99s forecasts said as much.  David Von Drehle marvels in his column <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d33/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/21/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a> for today\xe2\x80\x99s paper that Irma reminds us of all we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the natural world: \xe2\x80\x9cAs 21st-century heirs to the Enlightenment, we know an awful lot. We know how to edit a gene. We know how to convert millions of simultaneous messages \xe2\x80\x94 conversations, texts, memes, movies \xe2\x80\x94 into packets of ones and zeros and speed them from tower to tower to another person\xe2\x80\x99s hand. We know how to convert the energy of sunlight into a ride in the car. Yet we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know everything. In the case of Irma, meteorologists and their computers could read the air currents across a hemisphere and forecast the storm\xe2\x80\x99s eventual collision with an air mass that would push it sharply to the north. What they could not predict five days in advance, the hole in their knowledge, was the precise spot above Earth where the collision would occur...  \xe2\x80\x9cOne could choose to marvel at the overall accuracy of the forecast or grumble about its imperfection. The difference is largely a matter of temperament,\xe2\x80\x9d David concludes. \xe2\x80\x9cAcross the C bbean, throughout Florida, in sodden Houston and shaken Mexico and elsewhere in this world of death and woe, nature is reminding us of all we have yet to learn \xe2\x80\x94 and all that is beyond our paltry control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d34/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/22/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a>  Water recedes in Tampa ahead of Hurricane Irma  IRMA LATEST:  -- Hurricane Irma plowed into Florida on Sunday, reminding\xc2\xa0everyone that when a tropical cyclone reaches a certain size, \xe2\x80\x9cit simply can\xe2\x80\x99t miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0From\xc2\xa0Patricia Sullivan, Leonard Shapiro, Perry Stein and Joel Achenbach <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/9d35/59b66e32fe1ff671d4f2780a/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/23/104/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a>: \xe2\x80\x9cThis storm was nearly as big as the state of Florida, which is why everything but the Panhandle was under a hurricane warning.

Event details: This is a low-key games gathering in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria. \xc2\xa0What games are played depends on who & how many show, and what they're in the mood for. \xc2\xa0This is meant to be a more laid-back, low-commitment games night. \xc2\xa0Come when you can, but the doors open at 6 and close at 10. FOOD: \xc2\xa0I try to provide a crockpot soup for those coming in need of sustenance. \xc2\xa0If you feel motivated to bring something to share, feel free but it is not required.  -------  You're getting this message because your Meetup account is connected to this email address.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)  <>   \xc2\xa0 BY JAMES HOHMANN <>  with Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve  THE BIG IDEA:\xc2\xa0In Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tempest,\xe2\x80\x9d a storm shipwrecks Trinculo on an unfamiliar island. To survive, he takes shelter with Caliban, a native who he at first mistakes for a fish. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows,\xe2\x80\x9d Trinculo tells the audience near the start of Act 2. \xe2\x80\x9cI will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.\xe2\x80\x9d  Four centuries later, Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ascension to the presidency has created a fe ng of misery for leading establishment figures of both parties. So much of what they thought they understood about politics turned out to be wrong during the 2016 cycle. Trump violated a dizzying number of shibboleths as a candidate and has tested norms of behavior during his first eight months in office.  Two such figures are teaming up to push back on Trumpism. William Kristol, the founder and editor at large of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, and William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, are launching The New Center Project, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Their effort is being sponsored by the No Labels Foundation.  Kristol was the chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle when Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush in 1992. Galston joined the new Clinton White House as a top domestic policy adviser. Focused on passing HillaryCare, he vividly remembers Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s se ng (and successful) activism against that effort.  They\xe2\x80\x99ve debated each other repeatedly at public events over the years, including on several college campuses, but Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rise inspired the two Bills to recognize how much common ground they share. Until Nov. 8, 2016, each now says he took for granted the public\xe2\x80\x99s support for basic institutions and the core principles of liberal democracy.  After nine months of conversations, the two have co-written\xc2\xa0a new 70-page pamphlet <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/a06d/59b7bf93fe1ff671d4f27b5e/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/12/123/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a> that outlines seven \xe2\x80\x9cIdeas to Re-center America.\xe2\x80\x9d This odd couple discussed their collaboration and previewed their proposals during a long lunch yesterday at the Bombay Club, a white-linen-tablecloth Indian restaurant one block from the White House.  \xe2\x80\x9cSimply bewailing the demagoguery does not solve the problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Kristol said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was more general agreement and manageable differences than I expected.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThis booklet was our effort to figure out what the heck was going on and what we might do about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Galston said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese ideas might appeal to a lot of people between the 35-yard lines in American politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  Galston, 71, has devoted most of his career to trying to revive the vital center. (He even worked on John Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in 1980.) But Kristol, 64, had never dabbled in centrist politics before he became a Never Trumper. An avatar of neoconservatism, it never would have occurred to anyone to refer to Kristol as a moderate before now.  Both men, who have backgrounds in political science, embarked on a period of soul searching after the election to try understanding how the electorate could have possibly grown so disillusioned with the status quo despite years of decent economic growth. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that Trump won, but they were also puzzled by how Bernie Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 a septuagen an socialist from Vermont \xe2\x80\x94 could came so close to toppling Hillary Clinton in the Democratic prim es.  The loss of faith in both parties was much worse than they realized from their cushy offices in the Beltway. Kristol said the writing process has made him much more respectful of voter distaste for GOP orthodoxy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was more being missed by Republican politicians and think tanks than I realized,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been far more sclerosis than we wanted to admit,\xe2\x80\x9d Galston added.  The Bills say that their vision is for \xe2\x80\x9ca new center\xe2\x80\x9d that does not split the difference between left and right but offers a principled alternative to both. They spoke with dozens of friends at think tanks across the ideological spectrum, from the libert an Cato Institute to the liberal Economic Policy Institute and the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \xe2\x80\x9cGrievance is not a basis for governance,\xe2\x80\x9d they declare in their report.  William Kristol is co-chairing a new group proposing principled alternatives to Trumpism. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)  -- Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick sketch of their seven ideas:  1) Challenging the concentration of power among technology titans with a new antitrust policy: They advocate revising the Sherman Act of 1890 to make it easier for the federal government to go after companies like Google and Facebook, which they see as near monopolies. They call for a crackdown on predatory pricing practices, more scrutiny of mergers and better enforcement by the Justice Department.  2) Taking on China over its theft of American intellectual property: They want to increase federal funding for basic research and development that got slashed because of sequestration, overhaul the patent system and put in place stiffer penalties for IP theft. They b eve the U.S. government should not allow any other nation to require American firms to transfer control of their technology as a condition for doing business in that country.  3) Incentivizing work: America\xe2\x80\x99s labor force participation rate has declined more than any other advanced nation since 2000, and the Bills b eve there are 10 million Americans who could or should be working but are not. They want to create a new regime of carrots and sticks to slash that number. They argue that better workforce development programs \xe2\x80\x94 always the go-to answer for politicians in both parties \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t address the problem of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to work. They think the government should be more willing to \xe2\x80\x9ccall laziness what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d aggressively go after fraud in disability programs, make it easier for convicted criminals to reenter society, and provide more tax credits to help families pay for child care. Inspired by Perkins Loans, they call for the federal government to make more education funding conditional upon students majoring in subjects where future job shortages are projected.  4) Getting economic growth to benefit the middle class more directly: Worried about stagnant median incomes and the increasing concentration of wealth among the richest 1 percent, the Bills call for once again taxing capital gains as income, expanding the earned income tax credit and incentivizing more profit-sh ng by corporations. Not only do they want to increase the federal minimum wage, but both think it should be indexed to inflation.  5) Proposing a grand bargain that overhauls the tax code and funds infrastructure at the same time: They advocate for a package that would include a dedicated stream of revenue, such as a tax on repatriated corporate profits, to invest in roads, bridges and the like. With the national debt so large, the Bills agree that overall taxes for high income earners should go no lower than current levels. They want to  minate credits and deductions so that they can reduce the tax burden on lower- and middle- income families. As part of a deal, they support more user fees \xe2\x80\x94 such as a freight tax \xe2\x80\x94 to pay for public infrastructure.  6) Encouraging more people to start new businesses: A World Bank study shows that there are 51 countries where it is easier to launch a start-up than in the United States, including Portugal and Panama. Millennials are more risk averse than previous generations because of the Great Recession, so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t launching as many new enterprises. To make it easier to get money, the Bills want to revise provisions of Dodd-Frank that made it harder for community banks to lend to new businesses. They want less red tape, more flexible lending from the Small Business Administration and changes to the tax code to encourage angel investors to funnel more money into venture capital.  7) Trying again on an overhaul of the immigration system: Both guys oppose reducing the net number of immigrants, a proposal by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) that Trump recently embraced. They want immigration policy to focus less on giving out visas for family reunification and more on whether someone will contribute directly to the economy. They propose coupling permanent legal status for illegal immigrants with mandatory tracking of expired visas. To encourage assimilation, they agree that basic English competence should be a requirement for completing the naturalization process.  -- This is by no means a comprehensive agenda. Their report does not deal with social issues or national security, for example. The Bills say this is merely a first crack, and that there are many more issues in which they\xe2\x80\x99ve found common ground \xe2\x80\x94 such as how to tackle the opioid epidemic. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a first draft of the first chapter,\xe2\x80\x9d Galston\xc2\xa0said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was proof of a concept,\xe2\x80\x9d Kristol added.  Their shared hope is that enterprising presidential candidates in both parties pick up some of these policies and run on them in 2020. They recognize that the 2018 midterms will not be animated by ideas but will rather be a referendum on Trump\xe2\x80\x99s performance.  Galston sees parallels with 1989. Democrats b eved for much of the previous year that Michael Dukakis would beat George H.W. Bush, and they found themselves mired in a civil war when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. That internecine warfare did not get resolved until Bill Clinton prevailed four years later. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no shock to a political party greater than losing an election it expects to win,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are much closer to the beginning of the process than the end in Democratic politics. 2017 is 1989.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most Democrats opposed NAFTA when Clinton endorsed it, Galston recalls. He thinks ambitious pols would be wise to learn from that by embracing ideas that might play better in a general election than in the prim es. \xe2\x80\x9cI do think there are opportunities for political entrepreneurship among people who are willing to take risks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

But many are privately wondering if these are the first of a wave of retirements similar to what was seen in 2006, when Democrats took the House by winning 30 seats, and 2010, when Republicans reclaimed the majority with a 64-seat swing.\xe2\x80\x9d  -- Mitt Romney may run for Senate in 2018 if Orrin Hatch decides to retire,\xc2\xa0Utah Policy\xe2\x80\x99s Bryan Schott reports <https://s2.washingtonpost.com/a092/59b7bf93fe1ff671d4f27b5e/anJjZWRyaWNAZ21haWwuY29t/69/123/58a8d5aa269308c15ec50dc2851bf46a>: \xe2\x80\x9cSo far, Hatch has not made up his mind as to whether he\'ll run for an eighth term in 2018.
