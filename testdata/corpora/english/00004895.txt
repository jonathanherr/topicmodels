Southern California Gas Company	Comments and Proposal
SoCal proposes a 5-step process: 
(1) convert all full requirements service to contract demand service and fix capacity rights. Allocate current firm mainline capacity first among CD and FR BD quantities, then any remaining capacity to FR shippers as additional CD volumes to meet former full requirements load. Any additional FR capacity should be met first by the capacity rationalization process and then by construction.
(2) fully path system from wellhead receipt points to delivery points. Proposal combines pooling with firm capacity rights to the wellhead. Establishes new Mainline Pools for west flow (Cornudas and Window Rock) and for east flow (Laguna East, Plains East, Pecos East, and Keystone East). El Paso’s proposed 20 pools (or the six current pools if preferred) would be Supply Pools. The Supply Pools would be arranged from furthest to nearest the relevant Mainline Pool, and would receive gas at the receipt point locations within that pool, and, to the extent there are upstream pools, from those upstream pools. (Note: Filing contains schematics that illustrate this concept.) Receipt point capacity would be associated with only one Supply Pool, and gas at each receipt point can flow either directly to a TSA or into a pooling agreement (PSA). Each Supply Pool which does not flow into a TSA would have only one downstream pool to which it would be able to transfer gas. Primary take-away capacity at the Mainline Pool points would be limited to the physical downstream capacity to move gas away, and the primary receipt capacity of the Supply Pools could not exceed the capacity of the Mainline Pools to which they are associated. Gas could only move out of the Mainline Pools under a TSA, but poolers may have one or more PSAs for each pool. Poolers can take gas from any producer at any receipt point within a pool where it has a PSA and can transfer the gas to any TSA with primary receipt capacity at or through the same pool or to another pooler’s PSA at the same pool. Gas not so transferred would automatically be made available downstream to the next in line pool, but on a subordinate basis to TSAs in the event of constraints. Each shipper’s TSA would have a pool or pools associated with each of the Supply Pools at which the shipper’s TSA has primary receipt capacity. Specific receipt capacity in each pool should be allocated under a one-time iterative process. Shippers would be allowed to specify a minimum quantity at each receipt point or pool to avoid holding small fragments of capacity.
(3) maintain the use of pooling to supplement capacity rights from receipt to delivery points. (See above discussion.)
(4) conduct a one-time capacity rationalization process to allocate capacity. Once the process of allocating receipt capacity rights and use of pooling is completed, firm shippers can offer capacity they wish to sell as a permanent release through the normal processes. This would allow the FR shippers who need more capacity than they were awarded an opportunity to purchase in an open market on a competitive basis. If a party is awarded capacity it does not want to retain and it is unable to permanently release, that capacity should be returned to El Paso for additional sales or to eliminate the need for construction of new facilities.
(5) construct new facilities necessary to meet customer needs above that load established in this proceeding. El Paso should be prepared and willing to construct additional capacity to serve expected load of the EOC customers who do not have access to another pipeline. EOC customers should expect to pay the system rates for the new capacity.	
Arizona Corporation Commission	Comments
ACC wants a hearing, because “[t]he potential implications on natural gas and electricity service in Arizona are too great to rush into a decision on the merits, based upon the limited record to this point.” El Paso has not provided sufficient information to evaluate the assumptions it has made in running the various capacity allocation proposals. ACC argues that Arizona shippers are almost totally captive to El Paso and that FERC must ensure that any changes will not cause service quality degradation for captive shippers or economic harm to the Southwestern economy. ACC counters arguments that full requirements shippers are not captive and alleges that some parties believe Arizona shippers should only be allowed to utilize capacity to the extent that California does not want to use El Paso. If FR shippers’ rights are degraded as a result of this proceeding, CD shippers will extort extremely high prices to release capacity to those who have no other pipeline options. ACC charges El Paso has made no effort to meet the needs of existing shippers, all the while pursuing a variety of expansions for new shippers. Pro rata allocations is another symptom of El Paso’s failure to meet the needs of its shippers. ACC supports demand charge credits, as well as Enron’s proposal in RP01-484 for voluntary capacity turnbacks. If Arizona shippers’ rights are somehow degraded through this process, FERC must provide a sizeable transition period. ACC did not support any of the El Paso studies, but raised issues on each; the least objectionable to ACC was 4A, but it did not consider any seasonal diversity.
