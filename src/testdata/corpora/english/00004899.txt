Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation	El Paso’s proposal to expand the number of pooling areas should be rejected. El Paso should divide primary receipt rights among the existing six pooling areas only, and the Commission should reevaluate the need for pooling changes after the allocation plan has been implemented and operated for a sufficient amount of time to determine if changes are even necessary.
 In addition, El Paso should modify its capacity allocation plan to allow shippers who have executed binding agreements that become effective in the future to participate in the election process (Aquila apparently has signed a 15-year deal for expiring capacity that does not take effect until April 2002 and the existing shipper will get to choose the receipt points.)
	
Arizona Corporation Commission	ACC wants a hearing, because “[t]he potential implications on natural gas and electricity service in Arizona are too great to rush into a decision on the merits, based upon the limited record to this point.” El Paso has not provided sufficient information to evaluate the assumptions it has made in running the various capacity allocation proposals. ACC argues that Arizona shippers are almost totally captive to El Paso and that FERC must ensure that any changes will not cause service quality degradation for captive shippers or economic harm to the Southwestern economy. ACC counters arguments that full requirements shippers are not captive and alleges that some parties believe Arizona shippers should only be allowed to utilize capacity to the extent that California does not want to use El Paso. If FR shippers’ rights are degraded as a result of this proceeding, CD shippers will extort extremely high prices to release capacity to those who have no other pipeline options. ACC charges El Paso has made no effort to meet the needs of existing shippers, all the while pursuing a variety of expansions for new shippers. Pro rata allocations is another symptom of El Paso’s failure to meet the needs of its shippers. ACC supports demand charge credits, as well as Enron’s proposal in RP01-484 for voluntary capacity turnbacks. If Arizona shippers’ rights are somehow degraded through this process, FERC must provide a sizeable transition period. ACC did not support any of the El Paso studies, but raised issues on each; the least objectionable to ACC was 4A, but it did not consider any seasonal diversity.	
Arizona Public Service Company and
 Pinnacle West Energy Corporation	These comments address (1) the statutory standards required to lawfully alter an existing contract and/or practice, (2) the specific capacity allocation studies prepared by El Paso, and (3) the procedural steps necessary for the Commission to resolve the outstanding issues in this proceeding.

 APS/PWEC state that there is no evidence that the pro rata method of allocating capacity is unjust and unduly discriminatory or is inconsistent with the manner in which it was intended to operate as agreed to in the Settlement. APS/PWEC maintain that none of the evidentiary burdens that must be met in order to alter such an established practice can be satisfied in this proceeding: (1) the Full Requirements billing determinants were negotiated as part of the settlement and the 1996 Settlement provides that parties have waived their rights to file a Section 5 complaint against terms and conditions that were expressly agreed to in the Settlement, (2) changing the existing rights and cost responsibilities of the Full Requirements shippers would be an abrogation of their contracts and would require satisfying the Mobile-Sierra higher “public interest” test, and (3) Section 5 of the NGA requires parties seeking tariff changes to not only provide evidence that the existing service is unjust and unreasonable but also to prove that the proposed service is just and reasonable. APS/PWEC state that any resolution that requires reduction of only Full Requirements contractual entitlements while maintaining CD service at 100% is inherently unjust and unreasonable as it is patently discriminatory. APS/PWEC would agree to not requiring a hearing, but only if the Commission accepts as undisputed facts the Affidavits attached to its filing which state that APS/PWEC relied on the rates and terms and conditions of the 1996 Settlement and APS’ TSA in its planning for power plant additions, and that APS agreed to pay higher rates and contribute dollars to resolve the turnback issue in consideration of El Paso’s agreement to maintain the capacity rights of Full Requirements customers during the 10-year Settlement.	
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.	No need for additional hearing procedures. This proceeding is ripe for a prompt Commission decision.
 The Commission should approve El Paso’s “Study 2” proposal subject to modifications. This proposal ensures that both CD and FR customers get the capacity for which they pay demand charges.
 FR shippers should not get higher scheduling priority over CD shippers when scheduling alternate receipt to primary delivery point hauls.
 The Commission should reject El Paso’s proposed 20 pools and require it to allocate capacity based on 6 pools, which should be defined in the tariff. Duke would not object to allowing specific receipt points as long as pools could also be primary receipt points.
 When the order on allocation methodology is issued, the Commission should also require El Paso to comply immediately with the pathing, segmentation, and discount portability requirements of Order 637.	
Dynegy Marketing and Trade	Dynegy does not object to El Paso’s original proposal, but does object to (1) the fact that segmentation and within-the-path allocation were not addressed, (2) El Paso did not path its system because of FR service, and (3) the change from six to twenty pooling areas. Dynegy states that El Paso should be required to implement segmentation and within-the-path allocation as part of the reallocation process, to hold FR shippers to a specific contract entitlement, and to maintain the current six pooling areas.	
East of California Shippers
 (Apache Nitrogen Products, Inc.; Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc.; ASARCO, Inc.; BHP Copper, Inc.; Arizona Gas Division of Citizens Communications Company; El Paso Electric Company; El Paso Municipal Customer Group; Phelps Dodge Corporation; Public Service Company of New Mexico; Salt River Project; and Southern Union Gas Company)	EOC focused its comments on procedural issues, referring on substantive matters to its May 17 comments on El Paso’s proposal. EOC says a hearing is required due to the numerous unresolved issues of material fact which must be considered before the Commission can rule on the merits of El Paso’s proposal. The threshold issue is how much capacity exists to be allocated. The issue of capacity over-subscription should be decided in RP01-486 (the complaint filed by Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona Shippers). The Commission can only impose a new allocation proposal after finding that the existing provision is unjust or unreasonable, and nothing in this record supports such a finding. There is also not enough evidence to indicate that the new allocation method is a just and reasonable substitute. The data El Paso has provided in justification of its proposal includes erroneous customer data. Also, El Paso refused to provide studies addressing the historical usage of the CD customers; all supplemental studies assumed full CD usage but actual operational data for full requirements, which is not realistic.	
El Paso Electric Company	Lack of adequate mainline capacity is the underlying problem and the Commission should address and remedy that problem (in the RP01-486 proceeding) before allocating receipt capacity in this proceeding. El Paso Electric argues that this proceeding requires a full on-the-record hearing with discovery, but that if the request for hearing is rejected and the Commission makes a decision on the filed comments, it offers several comments without waiving its right to object to and appeal any determination that alters the current pro rata allocation methods. The comments are as follows: 
 FR allocations should be based on the non-coincident peaks of the most recent 12 months. 
 If the Commission does not intend to allocate receipt capacity based on the most recent 12-month NCP, it should suspend this case and maintain the status quo until it can remedy the underlying problem of mainline capacity deficiency. Remedies could include ordering El Paso to build more mainline capacity, ordering El Paso to rescind certain contracts, allocating some portion of “San Juan only” capacity to other basins, ordering CD customers to relinquish unused capacity, ordering reservation charge credits, ordering seasonal service with reassignment of capacity, voluntary modification of contracts with turnback, etc.
 If the Commission neither allocates based on most recent 12-month NCP nor suspends the allocation until after mainline capacity deficiency is remedied, then it should require El Paso to hold a special open season just for full requirements shippers. The open season would start by allowing all CD shippers to turn back capacity. The FR shippers would then bid for the turnback capacity, and, if successful, be permitted to convert to a CD contract. El Paso would be kept whole but would not profit from the process. FR shippers not converting to CD would retain their existing FR contracts.
 If FR allocations are not based on the most recent 12-month NCP, then they should be based on the average of the last five years’ NCP.
 If FR allocations are not based on NCP, then they should be based on the higher of billing determinants or the coincident peak in the past 12 months.
 Under no circumstances should FR allocations be based on billing determinants only.	
El Paso Natural Gas Company	El Paso agrees that it is appropriate for the Commission to resolve the issues raised by the FR load growth by determining (1) whether a limitation applies to the load growth that can be added to El Paso’s obligations under the FR agreements, given the contracts, settlements and applicable law, (2) whether FR customers should be converted to CD contracts and at what level, and (3) how the costs responsibility for any expansion be assigned among the FR customers. Any resolution should not impose additional cost responsibility on El Paso. El Paso believes that Billing Determinants are the best proxy for firm contract quantities that the FR shippers subscribed to in the settlement.
 El Paso believes it has arrived at the right number of pooling areas to maximize shippers’ flexibility in sourcing gas while providing more certainty in transportation services.	
Indicated Shippers
 (Aera Energy LLC; Amoco Production Company & BP Energy Company; Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Company; Coral Energy Resources LP; Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.; Conoco Inc.; Marathon Oil Company; and Texaco Natural Gas Inc.)	The Indicated Shippers ask the Commission to resolve this case as follows:
 Issue a preliminary ruling that FR contracts be capped at a reasonable level and converted to CD.
 Issue a preliminary ruling requiring El Paso to immediately start refunding demand charges for gas nominated within MDQ but not scheduled.

 Then, order a phased approach to the allocation process. As part of this process, CD shippers should be allowed to turnback capacity they do not need. The process would consist of two phases:
 Order El Paso to assign, within the next two months, primary firm rights on the basis of CDs, including the newly defined CDs for FR customers, for an interim transition period. For this process, there would be seven pools – the six existing plus a Bondad Station pool.
 Order El Paso within 18 months to “thread” or path its system by assigning primary firm capacity at specific receipt points, mainline segments, and specific delivery points, on the basis of the CDs that exist at that time. A “within-the-path” scheduling priority should be implemented at this time. Three pools, one for each producing basin, would be available for supply aggregation. Shippers would have the option to nominate from a pool for from a receipt point.

 For both phases, the Indicated Shippers do not object to El Paso relying on backhauls to create forward haul space along with OFOs to ensure that such backhauls occur, but only as long as the backhaul shippers are compensated for complying with OFOs.

 Indicated Shippers states that the primary issue blocking resolution of these matters is a policy issue that can be decided immediately by the Commission, i.e., whether the FR contracts continue to be in the public interest. Those who stand to benefit from the status quo will push hard for delay tactics, such as the need for more discovery, a hearing, etc., but the Commission should act now with a ruling.	
MGI Supply Ltd.	MGI Supply holds out no hope that the fundamental question at issue can be settled among the participants, and urges the Commission to resist any suggestions that further proceedings are needed to bring the matter to a close. The Commission should make a decision now on the merits.
 El Paso’s original proposal is a reasonable solution which can be implemented in the near-term, subject to requiring El Paso to expand its model to provide for full system pathing (receipt to delivery point) as soon as practicable. Full system pathing would enhance the value of capacity rights by offering defined system rights through constraint points and promoting segmentation.	
ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Co., L.P.	ONEOK requests that the Commission: (1) convert FR contracts to CD service, (2) fully path the El Paso system to the wellhead, (3) maintain the current six pools, (4) reject El Paso’s proposal to give a higher priority to FR shippers’ nominations in excess of billing determinants than to CD shippers’ nominations at alternate points., and (5) approve as necessary the construction of facilities necessary to meet El Paso’s firm obligations. ONEOK also opposes the use of OFOs for purposes not related to operational integrity, and strongly opposes any “must-flow” proposal. Also, ONEOK opposes the proposal that shippers with receipt rights in a single basin be allocated primary rights to each pooling area in that basis – such shippers should be allowed to select specific pooling areas the same as other shippers.	
Pacific Gas and Electric Company	Supports the initial comments filed by CPUC, Southern California Gas Company, and The Indicated Shippers. Urges prompt action.	
PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation	Increasing the number of pools will not create more capacity downstream and El Paso has not presented any reasonable justification for doing so. The Commission should reject El Paso’s proposal. El Paso should either keep the 6 pools it currently has or perhaps reduce to a pool for each of the 3 supply basins.
 PG&E-ET opposes allowing El Paso to mandate OFOs in order to create more firm capacity through displacement transactions.
 There is no justification for granting preferential priority to full requirements customers for use of alternate receipt points.	
Sid Richardson Energy Services Co.
 Sid Richardson Pipeline, Ltd. and
 Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.	El Paso’s proposal to disaggregate the six existing pool on the system into 20 pools should be rejected, even if the Commission otherwise accepts El Paso’s proposed receipt right allocation procedure.	
Southern California Edison Company	The Commission should initiate a full-blown inquiry into El Paso’s rates and practices under Section 5 (terminating the 1996 Settlement). If it does not do so, it should act expeditiously on the complaints in RP01-484 and RP01-486, as well as immediately limiting the service entitlements of FR customers and requiring reservation charge credits.	
Southern California Gas Company	Comments and Proposal
SoCal proposes a 5-step process: 
(1) convert all full requirements service to contract demand service and fix capacity rights. Allocate current firm mainline capacity first among CD and FR BD quantities, then any remaining capacity to FR shippers as additional CD volumes to meet former full requirements load. Any additional FR capacity should be met first by the capacity rationalization process and then by construction.
(2) fully path system from wellhead receipt points to delivery points. Proposal combines pooling with firm capacity rights to the wellhead. Establishes new Mainline Pools for west flow (Cornudas and Window Rock) and for east flow (Laguna East, Plains East, Pecos East, and Keystone East). El Paso’s proposed 20 pools (or the six current pools if preferred) would be Supply Pools. The Supply Pools would be arranged from furthest to nearest the relevant Mainline Pool, and would receive gas at the receipt point locations within that pool, and, to the extent there are upstream pools, from those upstream pools. (Note: Filing contains schematics that illustrate this concept.) Receipt point capacity would be associated with only one Supply Pool, and gas at each receipt point can flow either directly to a TSA or into a pooling agreement (PSA). Each Supply Pool which does not flow into a TSA would have only one downstream pool to which it would be able to transfer gas. Primary take-away capacity at the Mainline Pool points would be limited to the physical downstream capacity to move gas away, and the primary receipt capacity of the Supply Pools could not exceed the capacity of the Mainline Pools to which they are associated. Gas could only move out of the Mainline Pools under a TSA, but poolers may have one or more PSAs for each pool. Poolers can take gas from any producer at any receipt point within a pool where it has a PSA and can transfer the gas to any TSA with primary receipt capacity at or through the same pool or to another pooler’s PSA at the same pool. Gas not so transferred would automatically be made available downstream to the next in line pool, but on a subordinate basis to TSAs in the event of constraints. Each shipper’s TSA would have a pool or pools associated with each of the Supply Pools at which the shipper’s TSA has primary receipt capacity. Specific receipt capacity in each pool should be allocated under a one-time iterative process. Shippers would be allowed to specify a minimum quantity at each receipt point or pool to avoid holding small fragments of capacity.
(3) maintain the use of pooling to supplement capacity rights from receipt to delivery points. (See above discussion.)
(4) conduct a one-time capacity rationalization process to allocate capacity. Once the process of allocating receipt capacity rights and use of pooling is completed, firm shippers can offer capacity they wish to sell as a permanent release through the normal processes. This would allow the FR shippers who need more capacity than they were awarded an opportunity to purchase in an open market on a competitive basis. If a party is awarded capacity it does not want to retain and it is unable to permanently release, that capacity should be returned to El Paso for additional sales or to eliminate the need for construction of new facilities.
(5) construct new facilities necessary to meet customer needs above that load established in this proceeding. El Paso should be prepared and willing to construct additional capacity to serve expected load of the EOC customers who do not have access to another pipeline. EOC customers should expect to pay the system rates for the new capacity.	
Southern California Generation Coalition	SCGC supports conversion of the FR contracts to CD contracts at levels based on billing determinants. El Paso should be required to expand its system to meet its firm obligations and should, in the meantime, be required to provide demand charge credits for service not provided. The Commission should not allow protracted hearings, but should issue a merits order immediately.	
Southwest Gas Corporation	In light of the 10-year Settlement, the existing pro rata allocation method remains just and reasonable and should remain in effect with no limit placed on full requirements service.
 The Commission should consolidate the two complaints with this proceeding and set the consolidated case for hearing. The capacity allocation issues in this case include material issues of fact that must be addressed through an on-the-record hearing. 
 Southwest Gas proposes an alternative allocation procedure in the event the Commission decides that full requirements contracts should be limited. The alternative proposal would require full requirements customers to convert to contract demand service at current BD levels, and would permit them to increase their CD levels by receiving an allocated share of the Line 2000 capacity and the Line 2000 Power-Up, which El Paso would be required to construct. The Power-Up capacity would be subject to a surcharge. The process would include a one-time trading of monthly and seasonal capacity rights.
 In the event capacity rights are allocated, Southwest Gas wants the delivery point locations used in the allocation process to be enlarged or aggregated to the maximum extent possible without limiting operational capacity. Allocation among multiple delivery locations will degrade service flexibility for high priority captive customers.	
The Public Utilities Commission of the State of California	The CPUC states that the Commission first needs to clarify the extent of the rights of FR shippers for capacity on the El Paso system. The CPUC argues against any preferential treatment of FR shippers over CD shippers in use of alternate receipt points. It also uses the planned Transwestern Sun Devil Pipeline, which would bring Rocky Mountain and San Juan gas to Phoenix by January 2004, as a further justification for converting FR to CD contracts. As was set out in the complaint in RP01-484 which the CPUC filed with numerous other parties including SoCal Gas and several producers, the CPUC wants the Commission to convert FR contracts to CD contracts at reasonable CD levels, order El Paso to expand its system to meet the needs of all its firm shippers, and require El Paso to credit firm demand charges for gas within CD that is nominated but not scheduled. 	
Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company	The Commission should issue an order that: (1) requires El Paso to provide demand charge credits to firm shippers when firm nominations are cut, (2) converts FR contracts to CD contracts based on BD volumes, (3) requires El Paso to expand its system to provide enough capacity to meet its existing firm obligations. The Commission should also reject El Paso’s filed proposal because of the increased number of pools and the preferential priority given to FR shippers for alternate receipt points above BD volumes.
